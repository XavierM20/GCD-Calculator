This is a prgram from school where we had to make 3 different programs. 

Part1: Was to create a program that computes the Extended GCD of two integers and calculates the BÃ©zout coefficients using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Part2: Calculates the GCD of two integers using the consecutive Integer Checking Algorithm.

Part3: This script calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Middle-School Procedure. It handles special cases where both inputs are 0, returning "Undefined.
